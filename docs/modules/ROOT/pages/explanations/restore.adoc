= Instance Restores

This page describes the process how data is being restored from an instance backup.

== List Available Restores

Currently, it's not possible to view which backups are available and their backup times.
Please request the list via support channels included in your SLA.

== Trigger a Restore

Currently, it's not possible to select and apply a data restore to an instance.
Please request a service instance restoration via support channels included in your SLA.

== Process

Once a restore is triggered, during the duration of the restore process the service will have reduced availability or may be completely unavailable.
Redis clients will need to reconnect after the restore.
Depending on the client implementation this may require restarting the application.
