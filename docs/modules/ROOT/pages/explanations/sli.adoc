= Service Level Indicators

This page explains and defines Service Level Indicators (SLI) that are being measured continuously by the platform.

== SLI: Uptime

Uptime conditions::
- Redis responds to 95% of "ping" requests within a 1-minute interval.
  The requests are originating from within the same cluster.

Downtime conditions::
- Redis is not responding to "ping" requests within a 1-minute interval.

////
Comment: This section is applicable to all services and should be documented higher up.

Maintenance conditions::
- Instance is being automatically updated to a minor or patch version.
- Instance is being manually upgraded to a major version.
- Instance is being reconfigured by the customer (for example storage expansion).
- Instance is being restored from a backup.
- The platform itself is in maintenance mode and causes maintenance-related downtimes (for example Node drains).

=== Exclusions

These conditions do not count towards downtime in SLAs.

- Instances in downtime caused by customer error or abuse
- Maintenance conditions may cause a complete downtime
////

== SLI: Health

Degraded conditions::
- Redis responds between 1% and 95% of "ping" requests within a 1-minute interval.
- The configured storage volume is full.
- Redis continues to serve read operations, but denies write operations.

[NOTE]
====
Degraded instances do not count towards downtime in SLAs.
====

== SLI: Backup

Failure conditions::
- Backup process didn't start at the scheduled time.
- Backup process reported a failure.

[NOTE]
====
Failed instance backups do not count towards downtime in SLAs.
